# Changelog

## 1.1.1

- Declares itself an app template (`"usage": "template"` in `flock.app.json`), so Flock offers it as a starting point to make apps from, not as an app of its own. 1.1.0's installed copy had no `usage` and read as an app. Nothing else changed.

## 1.1.0

- Published as a marketplace app: `flock.app.json` carries the kit fields `template.json` held, plus `assemble: true` and `useCases`; `ARCHITECTURE.md` (shared kit architecture, then this app's own notes) replaces `TEMPLATE.md`. `template.json` and `TEMPLATE.md` are gone: Flock 0.15.0 reads `flock.app.json`. Needs Flock 0.15.0.

## 1.0.1

- Editors open in place: a picked deal opens under its row on the table and under its card in its column on the board (it opened above them). Add opens right under the page header. Escape closes either. Needs the Flock component library 1.3.0 (`expanded`, `InlinePanel`).

## 1.0.0

- First release as a marketplace kit app (moved from the Flock repo).
