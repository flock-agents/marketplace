# Pipeline: architecture

<!-- The part above "This app" is shared by every kit app and kept identical: its source is flock-agents/marketplace docs/marketplace-guide/kit-app-architecture.md. -->

## What a kit app is

A private `fullstack` app: a React page built with Vite (`src/`), a Hono backend run by bun (`server/`), one SQLite database per app, and a copy of Flock's component library in `src/flock/`. The backend mounts the Flock app kit (`@flock/app-kit`), which gives every kit app the same data routes, settings, samples, change log and chat hooks, so an agent that knows one kit app knows them all.

## Request lifecycle

1. The browser opens `/a/<app-id>/` on Flock. Flock serves the built page from `dist/` and adds the viewer's identity to every request; the page never sees a cookie or token.
2. The page calls its backend with relative paths (`./api/...`). Flock proxies `/a/<app-id>/api/*` to the app's own port; the backend is `server/index.ts`, bundled to `server/index.js` at build time, started as `bun server/index.js` and watched at `/api/health`.
3. `createFlockApp()` (`@flock/app-sdk`) gives the backend its Hono router and environment; `mountKit(flock, { schema, seed, ... })` opens `$APP_DATA_DIR/app.db`, syncs the Drizzle schema, runs the boot import or the seed on a first start, and mounts the kit routes:
   - `/api/_data/<table>` (GET with `?field=value&sort=-created_at&limit=&cursor=&q=`, POST, PATCH `/:id`, DELETE `/:id`), `/api/_data/_schema` (tables, columns, allowed values, route hints for private tables), `/api/_data/_events` (server-sent change events), `/api/_data/_changes/...` (undo), `/api/_data/_samples/clear`;
   - `/api/_app` (name, icon, `display`, `settings`) and `PATCH /api/_app/settings`;
   - `/api/health`, `/api/_me`, and the chat and approval relays the paired agent uses.
   The app's own routes (`server/*-routes.ts`) are mounted on the same router beside them.
4. Every write is stamped `updated_by` (`user:<id>` or `agent:<id>`), recorded in the kit's `_changes` table so the page can offer Undo, and announced on `_events` so open pages update live.

Agents write through the same routes with `curl` and an `X-Flock-Agent` header; the per-app section says which routes and values each app expects.

## Where things live

| Layer | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Page shell | `src/App.tsx` | `AppShell` with the page list, nav, the side `AgentChat` and its starter prompts; reads name, object, accent, starters and labels with `useApp()` |
| Pages | `src/pages/*.tsx` | One file per page; shared helpers and tone maps in `src/pages/shared.ts` |
| App CSS | `src/App.css` | The app's own styles and accent override, with theme tokens only (no raw colours) |
| Component library | `src/flock/` | `ui/`, `theme/`, `objects/`, `COMPONENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`: written by the assemble step, never by hand |
| Backend entry | `server/index.ts` | `createFlockApp()` + `mountKit()` + the app's own routes |
| Tables | `server/db/schema.ts` | Drizzle tables, each spreading `kitColumns()` (`id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`) |
| Allowed values, settings, people | `server/db/constants.ts` | Statuses, stages, slots, categories; `SETTINGS` declarations with their checks |
| Sample rows | `server/db/seed.ts` | Runs once on a first boot with empty tables and no import |
| Own routes | `server/*-routes.ts` | Totals, derived values and rules `/api/_data` cannot enforce; tested in `server/*.test.ts` |
| Manifest | `flock.app.json` | Name, icon, description, version; the platform fields; the kit fields (`pages`, `tables`, `objects`, `nav`, `chat`, `labels`, `settings`, `privateTables`, `titleFromName`); `useCases` |
| Generated catalogue | `catalog.json`, `row-schema.json`, `settings.json` | Written by Flock's `gen-schemas` from `schema.ts`, `constants.ts` and the manifest: the planner's view of the app (tables, columns, allowed values, settings and their rules), the JSON Schema an import is checked against, and each setting's declarative rule. Regenerate, never edit |
| Fixtures and tests | `e2e-rows.json`, `tests/`, `server/*.test.ts` | The end-to-end import fixture; pure tests runnable from the package; server tests run inside the built app |
| Build | `package.json` `app:build` | `bun install && tsc --noEmit && vite build && bun scripts/bundle-server.ts` |

## Build and deploy

Flock builds an installed copy, never the package in place:

1. **Assemble** (`"assemble": true`): copy the package to the app's source dir, copy the component library and the manifest's `objects` into `src/flock/`, add `scripts/bundle-server.ts`, and write the platform fields of `flock.app.json`. `@flock/app-kit` and `@flock/app-sdk` are supplied into `node_modules` by Flock, at the version this Flock speaks.
2. **Build** with `buildCommand` (`bun run app:build`): type-check, build the page to `dist/`, bundle the backend into one file. The result is `.flock-out/` (`dist/`, `server/index.js`, `flock.app.json`, `row-schema.json`), the only thing deployed (`deployDir`).
3. **Start** `bun server/index.js` in the deploy dir, wait for `/api/health`, pair the app with its agent (`config.requires.agent`), and commit the source into the paired agent's workspace as `hosted-apps/<app-id>`.

The app's id and name are not baked into the build: a kit runtime is built once per package version and shared by every copy of it. The page reads them at run time from the installed copy's `flock.app.json` through `GET /api/_app` (`useApp().name`), and Flock fills the `__APP_NAME__` token in `index.html`'s `<title>` each time it serves the page (`AppShell` never sets `document.title`; the title is the page's fallback name). A package with its own build command gets `FLOCK_APP_ID` / `FLOCK_APP_NAME` in the build's environment; the `__APP_ID__` placeholder in `package.json` is a legacy fallback for prebuilt packages that still carry it. A kit app names its package by its slug.

A bundled backend cannot load native modules or read files next to itself at run time (`import.meta.dir`); use neither.

An installed copy that nobody edited follows its package and the component library: a new package version, or a Flock upgrade with a newer library, rebuilds it. Once the owner or their agent has changed the copy, nothing moves until the owner asks for the update from the app's settings.

## How to add things

**A page.** Add `src/pages/<Name>Page.tsx`, list it in the `pages` array in `src/App.tsx` (id, `label("nav.<id>", fallback)`, icon) and render it on its hash route. Give it `label("title.<id>", fallback)` for its heading. Add the id to `pages` and the two labels to `labels` in `flock.app.json`. `nav: "auto"` shows no nav for one page, top tabs for two to four and a side nav for five or more.

**A table.** Add a `sqliteTable` in `server/db/schema.ts` spreading `kitColumns()`, export it, and add its name to `tables` in `flock.app.json`. It appears in `/api/_data` and `_schema` at the next start; the sync adds tables and columns without approval. Removing or renaming a table or column that holds rows goes to the owner's approval queue first (health says `schema: "blocked"` until they answer), so settle the shape before real rows exist. Put its sample rows in `seed.ts`, keep an allowed-value list in `constants.ts`, and regenerate `row-schema.json` and `catalog.json`. A table only the server may write goes in `mountKit`'s `privateTables` (hidden from `/api/_data`, with a route hint); a column the server derives goes in `serverColumns`.

**A setting.** Declare it in `SETTINGS` in `server/db/constants.ts` (`key`, `type`, `default`, `label`, `scope: "owner"`, and a `check` for anything beyond the type), passed to `mountKit` as `settings`. Repeat the declaration without the check in `flock.app.json` `settings`, then regenerate `settings.json` and `catalog.json`. Pages read it from `useApp().settings`, server code from `kit.settings.get(key)`; the owner or an agent changes it with `PATCH /api/_app/settings`. A bad value answers 400 naming the field; the default must pass its own check.

**A routine.** The paired agent does the recurring work and writes the result through `/api/_data` (a dashboard reading, a reminder drafted from overdue invoices): set the routine up on the agent, and point it at the routes and values the per-app section names. An app that needs its own scheduled work can declare `routines` in `flock.app.json` (see `apps/slack-desk`); pairing installs them on the agent.

**An object** (the sticker in the header or on a card). Pick one from the library with `find-object.sh`, add it to `objects` in `flock.app.json` so the assemble step copies it, and use it by name.

## Samples and import

- **Samples.** On the first start with empty tables the kit runs `seed.ts` and marks every row it wrote: `/api/_data` returns them with `"_sample": true`, pages show them lighter with a Sample chip and a banner offers **Clear samples** (`POST /api/_data/_samples/clear`). Editing a sample makes it the owner's; clearing keeps a sample that a real row points at. Keep the seed as it is and never put an owner's data in it.
- **Import.** When Flock installs the app with the owner's details already known, it writes `data/.flock/import.json` (`{ importId, by, settings?, rows, samples?, noSeed? }`) before the first start. `mountKit` applies it in one transaction after the schema sync and before any route answers: every row (parents first, `$ref` following the links `schema.ts` declares with `.references()`), the settings, and `samples` marked as samples instead of the seed. A failed import leaves the tables empty and is reported on `/api/health`. `row-schema.json` is what the request is checked against, and `e2e-rows.json` is the fixture the end-to-end flow imports.

## What must not be edited

- `src/flock/` is the component library's: the assemble step and every library update overwrite `ui/`, `theme/`, `COMPONENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION`. App-only objects added to `src/flock/objects/` are kept. Put the app's own CSS in `src/App.css` with theme tokens.
- The platform fields of `flock.app.json`: `type`, `access`, `spa`, `apiPrefix`, `buildCommand`, `buildDir`, `deployDir`, `processConfig`, `config.requires`, `assemble`. The deploy is a bundle; do not add a prune step or a `--watch`.
- `scripts/bundle-server.ts`, the generated `catalog.json`, `row-schema.json` and `settings.json`, and the kit's own `_` tables in the database.
- The name, object, accent, starters and labels are read at run time from `display` in the installed copy's `flock.app.json` (`GET /api/_app`); what `App.tsx` passes after `??` and the second argument of each `label(key, fallback)` are only fallbacks. When `display` sets a value, change it there, or the change in code never shows.

## This app: Pipeline

For deals that move through stages: sales leads, client proposals, orders, applications.
Start here when the owner says "track my deals", "pipeline", "leads" or "who are we waiting on".

### Data

One table (server/db/schema.ts) with the kit's `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`. Value is whole rupees.
- `deals`: `title`, `stage` (Lead, Talking, Proposal, Won, Lost), `owner`, `value`, `next_step`, `due` (ISO date of the next step).
  Agents must set `stage` to exactly one of the listed stages: a deal with any other stage has no lane and is left off the board and its count.

### Pages

- `board`: one lane per stage with the deals as cards. Dragging a card (or the Move to menu on a focused card) changes its stage. The strip above shows the value in each stage.
- Clicking a card or row opens the deal above the page: Edit, Delete (asks first, with Undo) and Close.
- `table`: every deal (soonest due first, no due date last), with search, a Stage filter, load more and an Add form.
- Two pages put the nav on top. The agent chat sits beside the page; the deal last clicked is sent as its context.

### What to change first

1. The stages: `STAGES` in server/db/constants.ts, and `STAGE_TONES` in src/pages/shared.ts.
   Renaming a column or table needs the owner's approval, so do it before the app has real rows. Changing the stage names only means updating existing rows.
2. The sample rows in server/db/seed.ts: replace them with the owner's real deals.
3. The page titles and nav names (each `label("title.<page>", …)` and `label("nav.<page>", …)`), the starter prompts in src/App.tsx and the accent (a name, one of coral, teal, blue, green, violet, amber; never a hex colour).
4. The object is `briefcase` (find others with find-object.sh).

### Words the owner can change (labels)

`noun.one` / `noun.many` (default deal / deals) rename what a row is across the pages. `stage.<Value>` (stage.Lead, stage.Talking, stage.Proposal, stage.Won, stage.Lost) reword a stage for display only: the stored stage stays one of Lead, Talking, Proposal, Won, Lost, so agents always write those values. The value strip, card value and Value column appear only once some row has a value.
