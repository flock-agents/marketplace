# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- **The app owns how its agent works.** `agentInterface` declares 20 operations and the agent's instructions; Flock 0.22.0
  puts them in the paired agent's context, so any agent paired with the app can run it (no skill to install). The full guide
  is the `guide` operation. Needs Flock 0.22.0.
- **A meal is a set of recipes plus a note.** The shopping need comes from the recipes; the agent reviews it against the note
  ("leftovers from tonight") in a background job. Only the agent creates recipes, and fills a planned recipe's lines at once.
- **Shopping windows.** One live draft per window with its span ("Thu breakfast → Sat dinner"): an evening reminder, a
  heads-up Checklist 15 minutes before, a price check across services with the best pick, then "Order with <service>". No yes
  in 3 hours lets the draft go quietly; "Skip this order" asks first, and only still-useful items move to the next order. At
  most three messages per window.
- **Stock and Pantry.** What was bought, drawn down by the meals cooked; long-shelf-life items assumed at home and checked by
  the agent now and then (one question about the coming meals). The Pantry page shows what is in the kitchen.
- **Learning.** Every choice is recorded; the agent finds patterns in a background job and the app applies the ones it marks.
- Groceries is now **Shopping**; a meal's chip appears only when it says something, and links to the items.
- New tables `ingredients`, `recipe_ingredients`, `diners`, `diner_portions`, `staples`, `carts` and private ones (stock,
  jobs, choices, learned prefs); existing rows are kept (additive schema).

## 1.1.2

- The icon is the app's own illustration (`icon.svg`, the grocery bag drawn in its header), in place of the 🍽️ emoji.

## 1.1.1

- Declares itself an app template (`"usage": "template"` in `flock.app.json`), so Flock offers it as a starting point to make apps from, not as an app of its own. 1.1.0's installed copy had no `usage` and read as an app. Nothing else changed.

## 1.1.0

- Published as a marketplace app: `flock.app.json` carries the kit fields `template.json` held, plus `assemble: true` and `useCases`; `ARCHITECTURE.md` (shared kit architecture, then this app's own notes) replaces `TEMPLATE.md`. `template.json` and `TEMPLATE.md` are gone: Flock 0.15.0 reads `flock.app.json`. Needs Flock 0.15.0.

## 1.0.1

- Editors open in place: "+ Add" on a meal, a dish, or an empty day opens the meal editor right there in the week, under the row tapped (it opened above the week and scrolled up). Escape closes it and focus goes back to what was tapped. Edit item on the grocery list opens under that item; a new recipe opens right under the page header. Needs the Flock component library 1.3.0 (`expanded`, `InlinePanel`).

## 1.0.0

- First release as a marketplace kit app (moved from the Flock repo).
